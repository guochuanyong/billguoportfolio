-Delete data from table in My sql

TRUNCATE TABLE calgary_assessments_points;
or
TRUNCATE TABLE calgary_assessments_points;

-Importing data in phpMyAdmin, how to exclude column names (doesnt really work, idk, maybe delete header from csv LOL?)

roll_year,roll_number,address,assessed_value,assessment_class_description,comm_name,year_of_construction,property_type,land_size_sf,mod_date,cpid,unique_key,latitude,longitude

-Deleting duplicate rows on roll_number column (not the best workaround, I'll have to think of something better)

DELETE t1
FROM calgary_assessments_points t1
JOIN calgary_assessments_points t2
  ON t1.roll_number = t2.roll_number
 AND t1.unique_key > t2.unique_key;
